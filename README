* BUILDING
1. Make sure cmake is installed
2. Make sure the Qt development libraries and header files are installed.
3. Prepare an simi-qt as an "out of source build" by running

$ mkdir build-dir
$ cd build-dir
$ ccmake /path/to/simi-qt-source-root/

Note you can use cmake-gui instead of ccmake if you prefer.
4. Now select the options you want.

DO_SUPERBUILD - 
If you do not have the VTK and/or ITK libraries installed then the superbuild mode
can build the ones you want for project development
	
	Select from:
	BUILD_ITK
	BUILD_VTK

	You will be presented with options that will let you choose your source for
	the libraries. Note this must be a git repository.

If you already have VTK and ITK installed on your system or you have already built them 
using the superbuild then you should disable DO_SUPERBUILD and reconfigure.

SQ_BUILD_TYPE - 
This specifies what the build type should be for the project. Note this has no affect on how the 
ITK and VTK libraries are built.


5. Generate the makefile from within ccmake or cmake-gui
6. Run
$ make
