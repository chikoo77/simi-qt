BUILDING
1. Make sure cmake is installed
2. Make sure the Qt development libraries and header files are installed. (when Qt is addded to project)
3. Prepare an simi-qt as an "out of source build" by running

$ mkdir build-dir
$ cd build-dir
$ ccmake /path/to/simi-qt-source-root/

4. Now select the options you want.

DO_SUPERBUILD - 
If you do not have the VTK and/or ITK libraries installed then the superbuild mode
can build the ones you want for project development
	
	Select from:
	BUILD_ITK

	You will be presented with options that will let you choose your source for
	the libraries. Note this must be a git repository.

If you already have VTK an ITK installed on your system or you have already built them 
using the superbuild then you should disable DO_SUPERBUILD.

5. Generate the makefile from within ccmake
6. Run
$ make
